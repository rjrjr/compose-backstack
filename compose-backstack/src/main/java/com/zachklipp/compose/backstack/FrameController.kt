/**

 * screens should be actively composed at any given time, and tweaking their appearance by applying
 * [Modifier]s.
 *
 * The [Backstack] composable will notify its controller whenever the backstack changes by calling
 * [updateBackstack], but the controller is in full control of when those changes actually get
 * reflected in the composition. For example, a controller may choose to keep some screens around
 * for a while, even after they're removed from the backstack, in order to animate their removal.
